# Password Generator

Password Generator - OOP

Requirements:

NodeJS
Inquirer
ES6 JS Classes
Character options: Special Characters (!,@,$,%), Numbers, Lowercase letters, Uppercase letters.


Instructions:

Refactor your previous password generator assignment to be a Command Line Interface (CLI) using Node, Inquirer, and ES6 Classes.
Your application should prompt a user for their desired password length and character options.
Your CLI should not have procedural code, or code that is not a method on a class.

Used previous assignment, "https://github.com/TaniaGM/Homework3" to convert into a jnode CLI to run in terminal to generate a password based on the same inputs (Upper, Lower, Numbers, Special Characters).
